# hello-world
This is my first repository!

I joined GitHub for several reasons.
I'm interested in the coding community and have been wanting to do this for a while but never got into it.
I started my account as part of an introduction to data science course on coursera through John's Hopkins and I'm LOVING IT.
Feel free to check out my account!  I'm interested in Java, R, Python, MATLAB and their applications in data analysis and complex problem solving for businesses.
